# STC15F2K60S2 Bad Apple Video Player (no sound)

Hacking STC C51 8x16 Led Game Kit

I programmed the chip to play video of Bad Apple.

See it in action : todo youtube link

This game kit is very affordable and some of them comes with STC15F2K60S2.

Features of the chip: 
* 60K Flash Memory
* 2K SRAM
* 2 Timers
* Hardware SPI

For this project I used a Nokia monochrome LCD display with 128x64 pixels.

Frames are stored in 'badAppleLow.bin' as binary file.
